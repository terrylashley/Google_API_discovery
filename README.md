# Google / WeatherMap API 

## Part I - WeatherPy

creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Utilizing [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Run linear regression on each relationship, separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression is modelling such as any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have.

### Part II - VacationPy

* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the homework.

  ![heatmap](Images/heatmap.png)

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.

* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
